# Images

Resources for creating the development/release environment, designed to work
both locally and with the DockerHub automated builds.

# Dockerfiles

### FROM

We are starting from the official base images of the distributions.

### ENV

OS_PLATFORM -- The platform name (e.g.  ubuntu-xenial) is encoded in the
               $OS_PLATFORM variable during build and runtime of all images.

COMMIT -- the sha1 of the git commit in the syslog-ng source tree that was
          used to generate the image.

### copy /dbld directory into the image

The entire dbld subdirectory (except files excluded by .dockerignore) are
copied into the image.  During runtime we mount syslog-ng/dbld into the same
directory, so if you are working on those files you may not need to
regenerate the entire image.

### package installation

In this section we will install all the dependencies we need, in the following order:

| Function | Reference | Description |
| - | - | - |
| install_apt_packages | [apt-get](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(Debian)) | See [packages.manifest](/dbld/packages.manifest) |
| install_pip_packages | [python -m pip](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/) | See [pip_packages.manifest](/dbld/pip_packages.manifest) |
| install_criterion | [Criterion](https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion) | We use criterion for unit testing. |
| install_gradle | [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) | We use gradle to build Java based drivers. |
| install_gosu \<platform\> | [Gosu](https://github.com/tianon/gosu) | We use gosu to drop root privileges inside the containers. |
> Note: These functions can be found in [dbld/builddeps](/dbld/builddeps)

### fake sudo
Just a simple `echo` command to make life easier. Reasons are explained in details in [/dbld/README.md](/dbld/README.md)

### volumes
Creating the `/source` and `/build` folders for our work. (note: `install` folder will be placed inside the build folder)

### entrypoint
Custom entrypoint script will create the user account inside the container, so you will not have any access problem with the mounted folders.

# Package lists

There are some helper functions to install special packages, but the main
source of the dependencies are the `*.manifest` files.  Lines started with #
are comments, and will be ignored.  The platform and/or distribution names
inside [] brackets are indicating on which platforms the package will be
installed.
