Description: Next generation system logging daemon (metapackage)
 syslog-ng is an enhanced syslog daemon, supporting, amongst others:
  * Powerful configurability, while still being readable
  * Filtering on any part of the syslog message
  * Support for both legacy BSD and the new syslog protocol
  * Wide range of source and destination drivers, including TCP
    (plain, or over SSL/TLS), UDP, SQL, MongoDB
  * Also supports fine-grained output format control
  * Multi-threaded operation
 .
 The wide range of plugins make syslog-ng able to perform well in
 every situation, ranging from enterprise-class centralised
 deployments, through personal computers to ad-hoc connected networks.
 .
 This package is a metapackage, depending on the rest of syslog-ng,
 including all available plugins. It can be safely removed, if only
 parts of syslog-ng need to be installed.
