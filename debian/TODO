* Upgrade issues

Issues that arise when upgrading from the unsplit Debian syslog-ng
from Squeeze (direct upgrades from earlier are not supported, and will
not be), and between split versions.

** Test upgrades from one major version to the other

Test what happens when we move from libsyslog-ng-3.3.1 to -3.3.2 or
even to -3.4. The expected scenario is that the old library gets
removed automatically.

* Packaging improvements

** systemd support

Test it, and figure out what else we need, apart from the service
file.
