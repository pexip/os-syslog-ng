 append custom name-value pairs on incoming logs (to enrich messages). 
 The database is a file that containing `<selector, name, value>` records.
 Currently only `CSV` format is supported. It is like `geoip parser` 
 where the selector is `$HOST`, but the user can define
 the selector, and also the database contents.
