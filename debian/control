 .
 Key features:
 .
  * receive and send RFC3164 and RFC5424 style syslog messages
  * work with any kind of unstructured data
  * receive and send JSON formatted messages

 This package provides the add-contextual-data module for syslog-ng.
 With this module syslog-ng can use an external database file to
 append custom name-value pairs on incoming logs (to enrich messages).
 The database is a file that containing `<selector, name, value>` records.
 Currently only `CSV` format is supported. It is like `geoip parser`
 where the selector is `$HOST`, but the user can define
 the selector, and also the database contents.
