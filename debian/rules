#* Environment setup
#
# If DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS has "debug" in it, we want to pass
# --enable-debug to configure.
#
# We also want to build in a separate build directory:
# debian/build-tree, because it's just so much easier to ignore files
# in there.
#
# By the way, if one wants to pass extra flags to configure, that can
# be done with EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTS, we don't override it, only append
# to it.

# update the rules for every major version if it can be helped, figure
# it out from the changelog instead.

# package has no build-dep-indeps, rightly so).
