# this matches the format originally specified in Mitre CEE (CTS) and
# Lumberjack projects. Now both of these projects are defunct, but there was
# some adoption, and rsyslog also supports this format as described here:
#
#   https://www.rsyslog.com/json-elasticsearch/
#
#
# We would put all name-value pairs under the ".cee." prefix, which you can
# drop on output if it's not needed.
