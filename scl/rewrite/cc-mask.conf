# The rewrite rules below can be used to mask out or hash credit card
# numbers in log messages.
#
# Their usage is simple:
#
# log {
#  source (s_local);
#  rewrite { credit-card-hash(); }; # or credit-card-mask();
#  destination (d_local);
# };
#
# For more information about the topic, see the following blog post:
#  http://marci.blogs.balabit.com/2013/02/masking-credit-card-numbers-in-log-messages-with-syslog-ng/
#
# A notable difference compared to the blog post, is that the hash_cc
# rule is called credit-card-hash and mask_cc is credit-card-mask.
