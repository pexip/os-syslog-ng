# This SCL module is a placeholder to override the contents of the system()
# source.  If the compiled plugin doesn't support your operating system, you
# can always define a block here to substitute for the compiled version.
#
# e.g. just create a "block source system { ... }" block in this file, and
# comment out the system-source module invocation.  This way even if
# unsupported by the C version of the plugin, you can still use the system()
# source in your configuration file.  Please if you have the need to do
# this, contact the syslog-ng developers and tell us about the omission.
#
# This is the mailing list address where developers are lurking:
#     syslog-ng@lists.balabit.hu.
#
# Alternatively, you can open an issue on github.com/balabit/syslog-ng
