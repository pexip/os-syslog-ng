* Finish migrating to libmongo-client
While the bulk of the code has been migrated, authentication does not
work with libmongo-client yet.

* Date type handling
It would be very useful if we could either recognise the various date
macros and store them as appropriate date-typed bson objects, or, if
that would be too intrusive, offer an option to put the timestamp
into a specified key.

* Documentation
There is some documentation in the syslog-ng@ mailing list archives
and on the project page at
http://asylum.madhouse-project.org/projects/syslog-ng/mongodb/, but
something closer to the driver would be preferable.

However, if/when the driver gets merged, this will stop being my
problem!
