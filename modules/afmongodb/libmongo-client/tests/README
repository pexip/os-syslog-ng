About the test suite 		-*- org -*-
====================

The test suite has two parts: the basic tests, which do not require
anything outside of this library, and networked tests, which require a
certain network setup if one wants to run them all.

The basic tests are run as part of `make check', while to run the
network tests, one must do a few other things, after which the
networked tests will be run aswell:

* Set up a mongodb server, and set up variables for the test suite

One must set the `TEST_PRIMARY' variable to the "IP:PORT" of the
mongodb server.

For example, assuming a bourne shell:

  $ TEST_PRIMARY="127.0.0.1:27017"; export TEST_PRIMARY

* To test replica sets, point the test suite to a secondary node

First of all, one will need to set up a Replica Set (see the mongodb
documentation for examples and a tutorial), and point the test suite
to a *secondary* node by setting the `TEST_SECONDARY' environment
variable:

  $ TEST_SECONDARY="127.0.0.1:27018"; export TEST_SECONDARY
