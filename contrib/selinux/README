SELINUX SUPPORT FOR SYSLOG-NG

  This directory contains syslog-ng's and additional plugins' SELinux policy
  files. By compiling and loading them into your kernel, your syslog-ng instance
  will be able to work with its default configuration in a SELinux enabled
  environment.

  SELinux support was added in syslog-ng 5.2 for the following platforms:

    Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOS/Oracle Linux 5
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOS/Oracle Linux 6

  Since then, support for the following platformas were added:

    Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOS/Oracle Linux 7
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOS/Oracle Linux 8


PRE-REQUISITES

  The installation steps may differ on these operating systems, so you will find
  RHEL version specific information, too. Root privileges are needed to run most
  commands.

  You need the following RPM packages pre-installed to be able to compile and
  load SELinux policy modules:

    policycoreutils
    policycoreutils-python
    policycoreutils-devel (only available on RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux 7)
    policycoreutils-python-utils (only available on RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux 8)
    selinux-policy-devel (only available on RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux 8)

  If they are not installed on your system, you can install them with the
  following command:

    # yum install policycoreutils policycoreutils-devel policycoreutils-python
      policycoreutils-python-utils selinux-policy-devel

  The SELinux policy is only checked/applied to the syslog-ng process if it is
  started by the init daemon or systemd (depending on the OS version).


INSTALLATION

  To compile and load this module, you have to run the 'syslog_ng.sh' script.
  It compiles and loads the syslog_ng SELinux policy module and policy modules
  for various other components depending on your choice. It also restores the
  right SELinux file contexts in syslog-ng's install directory. The changes will
  take effect after restarting syslog-ng:

    # cd /opt/syslog-ng/share/doc/selinux
    # ./syslog_ng.sh

  For information about restarting syslog-ng, please read the RESTARTING
  SYSLOG-NG section.


UNINSTALL

  The module will be active, until you remove it. After that you have to restart
  syslog-ng.

    # ./syslog_ng.sh --remove

  For information about restarting syslog-ng, please read the RESTARTING
  SYSLOG-NG section.


RESTARTING SYSLOG-NG

  You can restart syslog-ng on RHEL/CentOS/Oracle 5 and 6 by:

    # service syslog-ng restart

  On RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux 7 and 8 you have to run:

    # systemctl restart syslog-ng


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

  Syslog-ng is able to create coredumps and it's disabled by default. You can
  enable coredumps by

    # setsebool -P daemons_dump_core 1

  Please note, that this command enables core dumping for all daemons on your
  system,  not only for syslog-ng. There is no way to enable core dumps in
  SELinux on a per-application basis.

  If you have problems with SELinux and syslog-ng, you can turn to One
  Identity's support team.
