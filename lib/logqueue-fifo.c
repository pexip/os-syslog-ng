/*
 * LogFifo is a scalable first-in-first-output queue implementation, that:
 *
 *   - has a per-thread, unlocked input queue where threads can put their items
 *
 *   - has a locked wait-queue where items go once the per-thread input
 *     would be overflown or if the input thread goes to sleep (e.g.  one
 *     lock acquisition per a longer period)
 *
 *   - has an unlocked output queue where items from the wait queue go, once
 *     it becomes depleted.
 *
 * This means that items flow in this sequence from one list to the next:
 *
 *    input queue (per-thread) -> wait queue (locked) -> output queue (single-threaded)
 *
 * Fastpath is:
 *   - input threads putting elements on their per-thread queue (lockless)
 *   - output threads removing elements from the output queue (lockless)
 *
 * Slowpath:
 *   - input queue is overflown (or the input thread goes to sleep), wait
 *     queue mutex is grabbed, all elements are put to the wait queue.
 *
 *   - output queue is depleted, wait queue mutex is grabbed, all elements
 *     on the wait queue is put to the output queue
 *
 * Threading assumptions:
 *   - the head of the queue is only manipulated from the output thread
 *   - the tail of the queue is only manipulated from the input threads
 *
