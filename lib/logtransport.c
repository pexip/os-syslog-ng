       * written would overflow the buffer, it may reject it with
       * rc == -1 and errno set to EAGAIN.
       *
       * The issue is worse as AIX may indicate in poll() that the
       * pipe is writable, and then the pipe may flat out reject our
       * write() operation, resulting in a busy loop.
       *
       * The work around is to try to write the data in
       * ever-decreasing size, and only accept EAGAIN if a single byte
       * write is refused as well.
       *
       * Most UNIX platforms behaves better than that, but the AIX
       * implementation is still conforming, for now we only enable it
       * on AIX.
